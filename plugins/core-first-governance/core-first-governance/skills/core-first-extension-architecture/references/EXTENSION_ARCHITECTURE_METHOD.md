# Core-First Extension Architecture — Method

## 1. Purpose

This method is a domain-neutral software-engineering discipline for preventing local special-case implementations from eroding canonical ownership and reuse.

It is applicable to SaaS, APIs/backend, desktop software, CLI tools, libraries/SDKs, data pipelines, AI systems, internal tools, embedded systems, games, and structured software-supported workflows.

It is not a mandate to build plugin infrastructure.

## 2. Core model

```text
Requirement
→ Responsibility
→ Canonical Responsibility Owner / Master System
→ Capability Contract
→ Module / Implementation / Provider
→ Consumer Composition
→ Data / Modifier / Substitution
```

Orthogonal producer path:

```text
manual / code / agent / builder / importer / API / package
→ normalize
→ validate
→ canonical semantic representation
→ canonical responsibility-owner path
```

Runtime distinction:

```text
Definition / Profile
→ Runtime Instance
→ Scoped Mutable State
```

## 3. Phase 0 — discover responsibilities

For Greenfield work, broad product/subsystem work, architecture recovery, or unclear ownership:

1. List primary user/business outcomes.
2. Identify decisions and state that must be authoritative.
3. Trace important inputs, outputs, external systems, persistence, and lifecycle boundaries.
4. Identify policies/invariants that must remain consistent.
5. Group only responsibilities that genuinely belong together.
6. Record exclusions: what each owner explicitly does not own.
7. Identify the first reusable capabilities under each owner.

### Responsibility coverage challenge

Before treating a **broad** responsibility set as sufficient, ask:

> Could a competent domain expert immediately identify an important ordinary responsibility implied by the requested product that was never considered?

If yes, surface it before owner resolution and determine whether an existing owner already covers it, it is explicitly excluded/deferred, or it remains unresolved. Domain/product knowledge is a discovery hypothesis, not project authority: it must not invent optional features or override explicit user/project decisions. This challenge is materiality-gated; a narrow local edit does not trigger whole-product reconstruction.

Useful techniques are optional: use-case analysis, domain events, user journeys, data-flow analysis, API/call-graph inspection, test/fixture analysis, or bounded-context discovery.

The output is not a fixed number of systems. A small tool may need only a few durable responsibilities.

## 4. Structural roles

### Master System / Responsibility Owner
Owns a durable responsibility, universal policy, or authoritative state.

### Capability Contract
Defines a reusable semantic ability owned by a system.

### Module / Implementation
Reusable concrete behavior under a capability.

### Provider / Adapter
Implementation of a contract, especially across an external boundary.

### Consumer / Composition Host
Uses or composes capabilities/modules/providers while supplying identity/configuration.

### Definition / Profile
Durable declarative intent/configuration.

### Runtime Instance / Scoped State
Live mutable execution state. Never assume a shared definition object is safe for consumer-specific runtime state.

### Project Authority Artifact
A normative document/file records project truth about owners, contracts, rules, and decisions. It is not itself the runtime/domain owner. Generated indexes, Atlas views, summaries, or routing files may point to authorities but do not become semantic owners.

### Responsibility-relative owner resolution

Resolve ownership only after naming the responsibility. Do not let a class name, file boundary, implementation size, or user shorthand substitute for that decomposition.

Distinguish:

```text
canonical responsibility owner
current responsibility carrier / effective decision path
implementation anchor
capability contract
module/provider
consumer/composition host
definition/profile/data
planned migration target
unresolved ownership gap
```

Three common recovery cases:

1. **God/container class:** a large class may currently carry several legitimate responsibilities. Decompose them, then route each responsibility to an existing canonical owner/capability where supported. Do not create one new Master System per method group merely because the class is large.
2. **Parallel owner / foreign write:** if two active paths independently claim authority over the same responsibility, canonicalize them. If one path merely bypasses an already-established owner, treat it as a foreign-write violation instead of inventing a second owner. Multiple controlled providers behind one canonical capability are not multiple owners merely because implementations differ.
3. **Ownership gap:** detecting a gap means the current model lacks a supported canonical assignment; it does **not** prove a new owner is required. Test existing-owner/capability extension or composition, data/configuration, and module/provider paths first. If none is supported yet, keep the gap unresolved. Create a new owner only after evidence establishes a distinct responsibility and canonical boundary.

Ownership evidence is not a checklist of mandatory structural traits. Shared or distinct lifecycle, state proximity, number of consumers, and number of implementations can inform the decision but do not establish ownership by themselves. A legitimate owner may share a lifecycle with another owner and may have one consumer and one implementation.

Resolve architecture in semantic order: `Responsibility → Owner → Capability Contract`. A capability contract need not be a language-level interface, and an invented interface must not be used to manufacture or prove an owner.

Data centralization is not behavior convergence. A shared profile can own thresholds/patterns/definitions, but if every consumer still interprets and executes the same semantic rule independently, the behavior remains duplicated. Route shared semantic behavior through one reusable canonical path, which may be a small module/capability under an existing owner rather than a new service/system.

Capability identity is semantic. One implementation can satisfy a meaningful reusable contract; multiple implementations can remain variants of one contract. Never use implementation count alone to create, merge, or reject a capability.

Names are non-authoritative. `Service`, `Manager`, `Controller`, `Repository`, `Engine`, `Factory`, `Facade`, `Helper`, `Host`, `Renderer`, `Base`, or interface naming conventions do not determine architectural role.

## 5. Interaction semantics

Use only the semantic distinction universally:

- Command = request owner to perform change.
- Query = read/inspect.
- Event = authoritative fact already occurred.

Transport is project-specific. It may be a direct method, message queue, RPC, signal, callback, process boundary, or event system.

Do not introduce a universal event bus merely because events exist.

## 6. Change classification

Use one canonical taxonomy for actual architecture/behavior deltas:

1. DATA_OR_ASSET
2. VALUE_MODIFIER
3. CONFIG_OVERRIDE
4. SLOT_SUBSTITUTION
5. PROVIDER_SUBSTITUTION
6. COMPOSE_EXISTING_CAPABILITY
7. ADD_REUSABLE_MODULE
8. EXTEND_EXISTING_CAPABILITY
9. NEW_REUSABLE_CAPABILITY
10. NEW_ADAPTER_OR_PROVIDER
11. NEW_EXTENSION_POINT
12. EXTERNAL_CONTENT_PACKAGE
13. EXTERNAL_EXECUTABLE_EXTENSION
14. CORE_RULE_CHANGE
15. EXPLICIT_ONE_OFF_EXCEPTION

The classification is a decision aid, not a requirement to create matching classes/files.

`CORE_OWNER_REPLACEMENT` is an architecture migration, not ordinary customization.

Debugging, discovery, review, migration assessment, and reuse-proof work are task types rather than additional change classes. If no product/architecture delta is being classified, leave the change classification unset.

## 7. Extension decision test

Ask in order:

1. Is this only data/configuration/assets?
2. Is this a relative modifier?
3. Is this a substitution at an existing slot/provider boundary?
4. Can existing capabilities/modules be composed?
5. Is a reusable module missing beneath an existing capability?
6. Is the capability incomplete?
7. Is a genuinely new reusable semantic capability missing?
8. Is this only a new external adapter/provider?
9. Do several future producers/consumers actually require a declared extension point?
10. Is external package loading required, or is ordinary configuration sufficient?
11. Is executable third-party code truly required?
12. Does the universal rule itself need to change?
13. Is this genuinely a one-off exception?

Prefer the earliest sufficient answer.

External origin grants no extra authority. Third-party content/code must use the same responsibility-owner contracts and validation boundaries as first-party producers; it does not gain permission to mutate foreign authoritative state or create a parallel owner.

### Public extension-point contract

When a declared extension seam is material, record at least:
- stable ID/name;
- owner system and capability path;
- accepted definitions/interfaces/providers;
- discovery/registration/lookup;
- validation and required/optional dependencies;
- allowed variation/substitution semantics;
- forbidden foreign writes/bypasses;
- runtime/data trace;
- version/compatibility/migration needs where relevant;
- representative consumers/providers or equivalent reuse proof;
- acceptance evidence.

The extension point owns the seam, not all behavior behind it.

## 8. Capability granularity test

Create a capability when there is a coherent reusable semantic contract.

Do not create one merely because:
- a new data value appears;
- a single consumer needs a different number;
- a class would otherwise be large;
- an implementation detail has a name;
- future extensibility is merely imaginable.

A module/provider should remain beneath an existing capability when the contract is unchanged.

## 9. Producer convergence

Strong systems normalize equivalent producer intent before domain behavior.

### SaaS template example

```text
built-in template ───┐
UI builder ──────────┤
JSON import ─────────┼→ canonical TemplateDefinition → validation → Template owner/runtime
API creation ────────┤
external package ────┘
```

No builder-only execution engine.

### AI provider example

```text
OpenAI ─┐
Claude ─┤
Gemini ─┼→ LLM Provider Contract → Canonical Response / Tool semantics
Kimi ───┤
Local ──┘
```

The providers execute different code, but the surrounding product does not duplicate business rules per provider.

## 10. Domain-neutral examples

### Payment providers
`SYS-PAYMENTS → CAP-PAYMENT-PROVIDER → Stripe/Adyen/PayPal → Checkout`

Providers may call external APIs but do not own order state.

### Export formats
`SYS-EXPORT → CAP-EXPORTER → PDF/CSV/JSON → Report workflow`

### Data ingestion
`manual/CSV/bank sync/partner API → canonical Transaction → validation → Transaction owner`

### CLI tool
`SYS-OUTPUT → CAP-OUTPUT-FORMATTER → Table/JSON/YAML → multiple commands`

### Library
`SYS-STORAGE → CAP-STORAGE-BACKEND → Memory/File/PostgreSQL → same library API`

### AI system
`SYS-INFERENCE → CAP-MODEL-PROVIDER → OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepSeek/MiniMax/Kimi/local`

### Game origin case
Shared game systems → capabilities/modules → content composition → builder/import/mod convergence. This is only one case study.

## 11. Variation and modifier semantics

Prefer source-of-truth values plus declared variation.

If base = 5 and modifier = +8, resolved = 13; if base later becomes 7, resolved becomes 15.

When multiple modifiers can combine, the project must define deterministic semantics such as phases/ordering, precedence, scope, lifetime, and conflict behavior. The method does not impose one universal formula.

## 12. High-risk governance

### Core rule changes

Require:
- canonical owner identified;
- affected contracts/consumers identified;
- compatibility/migration impact assessed;
- acceptance behavior updated;
- canonical authority artifact updated where applicable;
- focused evidence/tests.

Local patches around the canonical owner are a failure mode.

### One-off exceptions

Require:
- explicit reason existing data/configuration/composition cannot express the need;
- exact owner and scope;
- reason it should remain isolated;
- regression evidence preventing accidental spread;
- revisit condition: if a second meaningful consumer needs similar behavior, reclassify it as a reusable capability/module candidate.

A one-off exception must not become an undocumented second architecture.

## 13. Reverse debugging

```text
observable failure
→ runtime/data flow
→ consumer/module/provider
→ contract
→ capability
→ canonical responsibility owner
→ implementation anchor
→ root cause
→ focused re-test
```

Do not patch an upstream symptom when the canonical owner is wrong.

## 14. Acceptance

Use only relevant tests:
- responsibility-to-owner/role mapping grounded in authority/runtime flow;
- current carrier distinguished from canonical owner where they differ;
- behavior convergence, not only centralized values;
- second-consumer/provider only when semantic reusability is the claim;
- producer convergence;
- no parallel owner;
- foreign-write rejection;
- dependency rejection;
- modifier propagation;
- definition/runtime-state isolation;
- compatibility/migration;
- actual observable behavior.

## 15. When not to use advanced extension machinery

For isolated local low-risk changes where owner/path and semantics are already clear and no material ownership/reuse/system-boundary decision remains, apply only the necessary ownership/reuse reasoning and stop there. File count or apparent difficulty alone does not require advanced extension machinery.

Examples:
- rename a label;
- change one constant;
- add a local command-line flag;
- fix a small parsing bug;
- update a static text resource.

No registry, manifest, plugin loader, extension point, service container, or event bus is required unless the product genuinely needs it.

## 16. Second-consumer proof without speculative product work

Use a meaningfully different second case only when testing whether a seam/capability is genuinely reusable. It is not an owner-admission rule and is not required to justify a responsibility owner. Do not add fake production features solely to prove abstraction.

Preferred proof order:

```text
real existing second consumer/provider
→ real planned second case already required
→ adversarial design scenario
→ isolated contract/test fixture
→ fresh-agent architecture challenge
```

The proof tests semantic reuse, not feature count.
